<h1 id="blog1">Character Build: The Slayer</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The nightmares plaguing this land--the undead, the vampires, the Daedra--they are rage. Brutal, without mercy. But he... he is worse. He alone can stand before the horde. His rage is their terror, and his might... their DOOM...</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>The concept for this build arose with the release of DOOM Eternal, which really got me itching to see how I could incorporate the DOOM Slayer's signature speed, ferocity, and weapon mastery into Skyrim. The resulting build is my little twist on the combat archer archetype, providing a fast-paced and brutal combat experience at all ranges. Get ready to rip and tear as you become...<p>

<p style="text-align:center;">This build makes use of a couple of common mods to enhance the gameplay experience to truly demonic proportions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">-Required Mods-</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ordinator:</strong> This perk overhaul brings the Slayer's skillset to life, offering fantastic synergies between the Light Armor and Archery skill trees and contributing to the Slayer's signature lightning-fast playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim:</strong> This mod gives the various standing stones within Skyrim more unique passive and active effects. For this build, the Shadow Stone will synergize beautifully with the relevant Ordinator Perks to give a helpful speed boost.</li>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">-Recommended Mods-</h2>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>VioLens or other killmove mods:</strong> It wasn't until about halfway through my playthrough that I realized how helpful VioLens was in creating that DOOM Slayer feeling. Being able to set killmoves to happen just about every time basically added the Glory Kill mechanic to the game when paired with my fists, which was glorious. I highly recommend adding this capability to your game.</li>
	<li><strong>Some kind of inventory management mod:</strong> You'll be juggling quite a few weapons in this build, so it may be helpful to have a mod that facilitates organization and rapid switching for the most seamless experience. I use SkyUI and haven't had any hangups about switching weapons in the middle of combat.</li>

 <p>In the deepest, darkest valley in High Rock, there lies an ancient, crumbling castle, standing proud in all of it's unholy glory. It looms over the surrounding area and smothers the light with unease. Legends say it holds all kind of wretched abominations, flesh monsters and legions of the damned. Legends say one of the damned rule them all. For as long as anyone can remember, the ancient Belmont bloodline of vampire hunters have sent thir young and brave to slay these filthy beasts. Every time they march proudly into that ruin, heads held high with rightous confidence. Every time, they never return.</p>

<p>Now, terrifying news of a plague of ancient vampires in Skyrim have reached the commoners of this god forsaken valley, and they have reached the ear of the king of the damned himself. Whether through kinship, pride or respect, the Lord had decided to extend his hand to his ancient brethren personally, and bring Bal's chosen together, so they may feast and rule in eternity.</p>

<p>The castle now lies empty, and the brief hope and celebration felt by the commoners has been replaced with hushed whispers and a deep sense of impending dread.</p>

<h3>General Build:</h3>
<p>The main idea/inspiration for this build is Dracula from the original Castlevania, and molds it's playsyle around his bossfight/general theme. What we have as a result is a master of evasion, an elusive caster who teleports around the battlefield, vanishing into mist all the while sending demons to harass their enemies or peppering them with fireballs from a hidden position.</p>
