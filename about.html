<p> I am a Senior at Michigan State University studying Media and Information. My focus area is Games and Interactive Development. I want to be a game developer, working as an animator. I have experience with the following programming languages:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Python</p></li>
	<li><p>C#</p></li>
	<li><p>C</p></li>
	<li><p>HTML</p></li>
</ul>
<p style=""> On my freetime I enjoy hiking, working out, playing video games, and hanging out with my friends. I consider myself an outdoor enthusiast, having hiked in many parts of the world. </p>
